* On Ubuntu/Debian-like Linux distributions, you need libgl1-mesa-dev and xorg-dev packages.
* On CentOS/Fedora-like Linux distributions, you need libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel packages.

**Pixel go library doesn’t support threads, that’s why we can observe some visual glitches on the ghosts
